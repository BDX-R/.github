## Overview

BDX-R is an open, community-driven biped platform focused on practical robot learning and reproducible sim-to-real. We provide robot descriptions, simulation assets, training tasks, and CAD models. 

This project is led by [Kayden Kapnik](https://github.com/KaydenKnapik). Find more information on our project documentation website: https://bdx-r.github.io/
